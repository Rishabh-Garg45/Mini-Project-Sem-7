# Water Bodies Detection on Land using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting **water bodies on land** using **Machine Learning**. It employs **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for **image classification** to determine whether a given land image contains a water body. The project also includes an **Android application (AquaDet)**, where the trained model is deployed for real-world use.

## 🚀 Methodology
1. **Dataset Collection**: Images of land with and without water bodies were gathered.
2. **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, augmentation, and splitting (Train:Test = 70:30).
3. **Model Training**: Various ML models were tested, with CNN achieving the best accuracy.
4. **Application Development**: Model was deployed in an Android app using **TensorFlow Lite**.

## 📊 Results
- **Highest Accuracy Achieved**: 100% using **CNN (ReLU Activation)**
